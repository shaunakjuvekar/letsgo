LetsGo: Your Online Travel Coordinator

Problem Statement
People enjoy traveling as a group because it reduces costs and keeps them safe. Still, VT students often find it difficult to form such groups to travel, especially as they may want to go to different places than their friends or existing peer groups. Existing solutions like the OCVT are more limited in scope, and not all students participate in those. We believe this shows a need for a centralized platform to form these connections.

Project Description
LetsGo - a social network-like web app for VT students to coordinate group travel arrangements. The platform will allow students to create profiles and specify their desired destinations. Other students can then search for people with common interests and communicate via messaging to organize shared trips.

To setup the project and get it up and running, refer to the ReadMe's in the frontend and backend folders respectivey.
